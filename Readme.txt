Steps to run this tool.
1.Copy all the files from to a local folder(e.g. Concentrating_Solar_Optimizer)
2.Download and install the free ray-tracing code,Soltrace, from the NREL website: https://www.nrel.gov/csp/soltrace-download 
3.Open Thermalmodel_v8.m on MATLAB and change file path(line 43) for Soltrace and your local folder(e.g.Concentrating_Solar_Optimizer) 
4.Run the GAmain.m on MATLAB to make the tool work.
5.Change the location dependent variables and other parameters on "Thermalmodel_v8.m" and "objectmain.m" to specify a new location based on your requirement to find the optimum design.
